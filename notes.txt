http if http is used by the server and vice versa !!!

How to differentiate between two of the same http response statuses?
if a company is registered, there is a possibility that the company name
and the provided representative email are already in use/taken/registered.
In both cases the http status 409 (conflict) gets send.
There is however no way of finding out if there is a conflict with the company name
or the representative email.

Possible solution: create new functions in the backend that check if the company name exists
and if the email is already taken or not. Then when someone tries to register a company, these functions
get called when the respective input fields are provided with data.

e.g user enteres 'Fluugle' in the company-name inputfield.
When the user leaves the input field (he/she goes to the next one for example)
a call gets made to the backend function companyNameExists().
Based on the response of this method, the front-end displays a succeed message or an error message.
Depending if the company name already exists or not.
