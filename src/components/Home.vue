      A platform for companies and students to

        How it works. As a student you create an account, upload your resume, write short
        descriptions about your past experiences and tell about your skills. Then, you scroll
        through the posted internship projects, you mark the ones your find interesting and you
        contact a representative from the company that posted the project.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center mt-4 bg-gray-100">
        As a recruiter, you browse and search to find students that you think fit
        within your company and contact you.
        The search goes both ways, from student to company, and from company to student.
        CScoupler provides a central place where this can happen, with a focus on internships.
